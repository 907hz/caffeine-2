We often look for caffeine when we're tired.
Caffeine is consumed in many foods.
</p>
<p>
<h2><u>Coffee</u></h2>
Caffeine is a substance contained in food or medicine that causes various physiological reactions in our body. About three-quarters of the caffeine we consume in our daily lives is due to coffee consumption. Coffee varies in caffeine content depending on its type or method of boiling. Among coffee beans, coffee beans contain the most caffeine, and it is usually believed that one cup of coffee contains about 103-112mg of caffeine. On the other hand, instant coffee, which is generally consumed a lot, or a cup of coffee with about two spoons of coffee powder, contains about 60mg of caffeine, that is, 30mg of caffeine per spoon of coffee powder. Decaffeinated coffee contains only about 2 to 5 milligrams of caffeine per glass, making it a fairly effective drink for those who dislike caffeine.

<h2><u>Green Tea</u></h2>
In the case of green tea, one cup (based on one tea bag) contains as little as 15mg, which is less than a quarter of the amount of coffee containing about 70mg. In general, caffeine elutes more easily at high temperatures, and coffee is usually made at high temperatures, but green tea is brewed at a lower temperature, so only 60-70% of the caffeine content in the tea leaves comes out. For this reason, in order to consume caffeine above the daily intake standard through green tea, you must drink an average of 26 cups of green tea per day.

<p>
<h2><u>Chocolate</u></h2>
Among the components of chocolate, the chemicals of interest are caffeine (C8H10N4O2) and theobromine (C7H8N4O2). Caffeine is a substance contained in coffee or soda, even though many readers do not know its chemical structure. A cup of coffee contains approximately 100 to 160 mg of caffeine. Of course, chocolate also contains approximately 20 to 100 mg of caffeine per 100 g. However, chocolate contains more theobromine than caffeine, which has almost the same chemical composition and molecular structure as caffeine. Theobromine is known for diuretic action, muscle relaxation, heart rate promotion, and vasodilation. It is a substance that can cause allergic reactions in dogs and cats, so if you give chocolate to your pet, you may be in trouble.
